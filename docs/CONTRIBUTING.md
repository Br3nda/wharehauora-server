# Contributing to Whare Hauora (server edition)

First of, thank you for taking the time to contribute ðŸŽ‰! We really appreciate it!

We are trying to get better at welcoming newcomers ðŸš§ and will keep working on this contributing guideline until is all shiny and magical and explains everything you need to know âœ¨. While we get there, here are a few things you can have a look at:

* [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [Info of our current work](https://github.com/WhareHauora/wharehauora-server/wiki)
* [Documentation](../docs)
* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/WhareHauora/wharehauora-server/issues)

If you are keen to help, jump into an issue and ask away, we'll answer as soon as we can. We also have a [Slack team](wharehauora.slack.com) to communicate, if you want to jump in there just ask one of our contributors for access.

We need help with all kinds of tasks, it doesn't have to be code! Documentation, design, contributing guidelines (Inception alert!), testing, repository organization or any other idea are welcome.

## TODOs for this guidelines
