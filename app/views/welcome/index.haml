%h2 WhareSensors are the affordable to measure the healthiness of our homes.

%p
  Whare Hauora is a charitable trust, working to measure the quality of
  the environment we live in: the rooms of our homes.

%h3 How do our sensors work?
%p
  WhareSensors measures the temperature and humidity of a room every 30
  seconds. Place sensors in each room you spend significant time in, your
  bedrooms, and the main living space. The sensors discover each other
  wirelessly and form a mesh network, sending their readings to each other.
  One "gateway" unit, placed in the centre of the home will gather up all
  readings, and send to Whare Hauora for analysis.

%h3 Compare your home against robust health standards.

%p
  Within days, we'll create a summary of the home environment, as it
  changes from day to night, warm to cold. Over the course of the year
  you'll create a profile of the seasons. You may learn that your child's
  room is well suited to sleeping in summer, but the temperature drops
  too low overnight in winter. Your living space may be too humid from
  cooking or lack of ventilation, and likely to allow mould growth.
  As you make changes to your home, you can measure the difference.
